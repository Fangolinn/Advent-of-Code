# My solutions to (some of) Advent of Code problems

https://adventofcode.com/

Some solutions are better, some worse, I intend to someday go back to the earlier ones to see how I have improved over time.

Unit tests written as needed and/or as I had the time and will to do so.

In most solutions an input file "input.txt" with problem input is expected, but that file is not present. That's because I used that method for input but later removed the files when making this repository public.
